This project contains a database, server, and client to allow providers to keep track of which Mental Health and Substance Abuse treatment facilities accept patients with bleeding disorders. It is done as contract work for BDSumhac.

Treatment facilities are almost never required to take patients, and can refuse for a variety of reasons. Patients with bleeding disorders are often refused by such facilities, often because their medicine requires IVs to administer. This can make it difficult for a provider to recommend a specific treatment facility for a patient with bleeding disorders, since there is a good chance they won't be accepted. This tool allows providers to query existing facilities and find ones that work for their patient.
